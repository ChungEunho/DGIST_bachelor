ðŸ•’ A Simple Alarm Clock Application

Waking up in the morning with heavy eyelids often made it difficult to read the alarm label on my phone screen.
I thought â€” what if the alarm could read the label out loud instead?
That way, I could keep my eyes closed and still hear what I needed to do for the day.

This small inconvenience became the motivation behind this project.
An alarm app that speaks the label aloud â€” that's the purpose and vision of this work.
