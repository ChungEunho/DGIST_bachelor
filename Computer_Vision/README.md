ðŸ§  Introduction to Computer Vision â€“ Course Projects
This directory includes selected assignments from the Introduction to Computer Vision course, covering key topics such as image segmentation, filtering, and camera calibration.

ðŸ“Œ Project 1 â€“ Image Preprocessing & Edge Detection
Letter Boundary Extraction

Download logo2_pr1.png from LMS

Extract only the boundaries of the letters from the image

Image Restoration â€“ Cars

Download cars_pr1.png from LMS

Apply noise reduction and contrast enhancement techniques

Restore the image to resemble the original as closely as possible

ðŸ“Œ Project 2 â€“ Orange Detection: Largest & Smallest
Given an image containing multiple oranges:

Segment each orange

Accurately identify the largest and smallest one based on area

Implement the solution using only basic image processing (thresholding, morphology, region labeling, etc.)

Assume oranges are roughly circular and correct for perspective distortion if necessary

ðŸ“Œ Project 3 â€“ Camera Calibration & Custom Marker Measurement
Perform camera calibration using a phone or webcam

Design and print a custom marker (not using existing ones like ArUco)

Attach markers to the four corners of a rectangular object

Take 4 images (one from each corner)

Write code to:

Detect the marker

Output coordinates of the 4 corner points

Calculate the lengths of the 4 sides

Discuss conditions that produce the most accurate measurement

Submit:

4 captured images

Code
